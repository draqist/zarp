    question: "What is Zarp and how does it work?",
    answer:
      "Zarp is a smart logistics platform that connects vendors, zarpers (delivery partners), and customers (zarpees) in one seamless ecosystem. Vendors list their products, zarpers pick up and deliver items, and zarpees receive them with real-time tracking and secure payments. The platform automates logistics routing, provides updates at every stage, and ensures all parties have a smooth experience. Whether you’re a vendor looking for reach, a zarper wanting flexible work, or a zarpee ordering goods, Zarp provides a transparent and efficient logistics solution.",

    answer:
      "Anyone with a valid form of identification, a reliable means of transport (bike, car, or van), and a smartphone can apply to become a zarper. Zarp values inclusivity and flexibility, meaning you can work on your own schedule, take as many or as few deliveries as you want, and earn based on completed trips. All zarpers go through a quick verification process to ensure safety and trustworthiness for vendors and zarpees.",

For zarpers, there’s insurance and support in case of incidents. For zarpees, all orders are tracked in real-time, and every delivery is backed with ratings and feedback. This multi-layer trust system ensures that everyone on the platform feels safe, informed, and supported at all times.",

    answer:
      "For zarpees (customers), Zarp charges a transparent delivery fee calculated based on distance, delivery type, and urgency. Vendors can choose flexible plans—pay per delivery or opt for subscription-based packages for frequent orders. Zarpers (delivery partners) don’t pay to join, but Zarp deducts a small service fee from each completed delivery to maintain platform quality and provide customer support. All costs are shown upfront before confirming an order, so there are no hidden surprises.",
