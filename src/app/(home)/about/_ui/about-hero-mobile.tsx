          Zarp was born from a simple frustration: missed packages, slow
          deliveries, and limited courier options. We set out to fix that. By
          connecting traditional delivery services with everyday drivers already
          on the move, weâ€™re making logistics faster, more reliable, and more
          affordable. What began as an idea to solve a personal problem is now
          growing into a community-powered movement to change how goods move
          across cities.
